## About

A `dataplex-lookup-entry` tool returns details of a particular entry in Dataplex Catalog.
It's compatible with the following sources:

- [dataplex](../sources/dataplex.md)

`dataplex-lookup-entry` takes a required `name` parameter which contains the project and location to which the request should be attributed in the following form: projects/{project}/locations/{location} and also a required `entry` parameter which is the resource name of the entry in the following form: projects/{project}/locations/{location}/entryGroups/{entryGroup}/entries/{entry}. It also optionally accepts following parameters:
  - `view` - View to control which parts of an entry the service should return. It takes integer values from 1-4 corresponding to type of view - BASIC, FULL, CUSTOM, ALL
  - `aspectTypes` - Limits the aspects returned to the provided aspect types in the format `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/aspectTypes/{aspectType}`. It only works for CUSTOM view.
  - `paths` - Limits the aspects returned to those associated with the provided paths within the Entry. It only works for CUSTOM view.

## Requirements

### IAM Permissions

Dataplex uses [Identity and Access Management (IAM)][iam-overview] to control
user and group access to Dataplex resources. Toolbox will use your 
[Application Default Credentials (ADC)][adc] to authorize and authenticate when 
interacting with [Dataplex][dataplex-docs].

In addition to [setting the ADC for your server][set-adc], you need to ensure
the IAM identity has been given the correct IAM permissions for the tasks you
intend to perform. See [Dataplex Universal Catalog IAM permissions][iam-permissions] 
and [Dataplex Universal Catalog IAM roles][iam-roles] for more information on
applying IAM permissions and roles to an identity.
