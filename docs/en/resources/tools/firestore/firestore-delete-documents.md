## About

A `firestore-delete-documents` tool deletes multiple documents from Firestore by their paths.
It's compatible with the following sources:

- [firestore](../sources/firestore.md)

`firestore-delete-documents` takes one input parameter `documentPaths` which is an array of 
document paths to delete. The tool uses Firestore's BulkWriter for efficient batch deletion
and returns the success status for each document.

## Example

```yaml
tools:
  delete_user_documents:
    kind: firestore-delete-documents
    source: my-firestore-source
    description: Use this tool to delete multiple documents from Firestore.
```
