## About

A `neo4j-cypher` tool executes a pre-defined Cypher statement against a Neo4j
database. It's compatible with any of the following sources:

- [neo4j](../../sources/neo4j.md)

The specified Cypher statement is executed as a [parameterized
statement][neo4j-parameters], and specified parameters will be used according to
their name: e.g. `$id`.

> **Note:** This tool uses parameterized queries to prevent SQL injections.
> Query parameters can be used as substitutes for arbitrary expressions.
> Parameters cannot be used as substitutes for identifiers, column names, table
> names, or other parts of the query.

## Example

```yaml
tools:
 search_movies_by_actor:
    kind: neo4j-cypher
    source: my-neo4j-movies-instance
    statement: |
      MATCH (m:Movie)<-[:ACTED_IN]-(p:Person)
      WHERE p.name = $name AND m.year > $year
      RETURN m.title, m.year
      LIMIT 10
